Hello! I’m Armita, and I’m on a mission to uncover the hidden connections between our genes, microbiota, and immune and nervous systems. I work as a researcher in a microbiology lab, where I focus on gaining a molecular perspective of human diseases.

I’m deeply fascinated by how details at the molecular level influence broader biological systems, offering new insights for health improvement and disease prevention. My background in microbiology, molecular biology, and computational biology allows me to approach these questions with a holistic perspective.

My Work and Research
======
As a researcher in a microbiology lab at the Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, I have been immersed in diverse projects in microbiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Currently, my focus is on bioinformatics applications in cellular and molecular biology, with experience that includes clinical microbiology research, where I am part of an anaerobic bacterial research group exploring gastrointestinal diseases, microbiome therapies, and drug delivery modeling.

Through projects like multilocus sequence typing of Clostridioides difficile and studying the protective effects of Lactobacillus crispatus in liver disease models, I’ve developed expertise in microbiome analysis, gene expression profiling, and computational biology techniques. Teaching biology alongside my research allows me to inspire students and share my excitement for uncovering the mysteries of life through both laboratory work and data analysis.

1. October 2024 – Exploring the Role of Non-Coding RNA in NAFLD and Lactobacillus Therapy
               We’re thrilled to announce the second phase of our project on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus strains! This time, we’re using RNA sequencing to dive deeper into non-coding RNAs that may influence NAFLD. Our goal is to identify specific non-coding RNAs that respond to Lactobacillus therapy and to understand how these RNAs could help protect liver health. Stay tuned as we uncover the next chapter in this exciting project!

1. June 2024 – New Project Launched on Bacterial Toxins and Autophagy! 
               Exciting news! We’ve assembled a talented team to investigate the impact of bacterial toxins on autophagy. Our project will begin with an in-depth review of current knowledge in the field, setting the stage for future in vivo experiments to explore how these toxins might influence cellular cleanup processes like autophagy. We hope this work will open doors to new insights into how pathogenic bacteria interact with human cells and contribute to diseases.



1. February 2024 – Upcoming Publication on Gut Microbiota and Physical Performance!
                Our research on the connection between gut microbiota and physical performance is about to make waves! We’re thrilled to share that our findings, soon to be published in Scientific Reports, reveal how specific microbiota compositions could shape athletic performance. By studying both professional and semi-professional athletes, we’ve identified fascinating patterns in gut health that might one day help optimize training and performance. We can’t wait for the scientific community to dive into these findings!



1. November 2023 – Investigating Akkermansia muciniphila’s Role in Apoptosis in Intestinal Cells
               Our team has been hard at work studying the effects of Akkermansia muciniphila, a key gut bacterium, on apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. This research could have important implications for gut health, as apoptosis (or programmed cell death) is critical in maintaining a healthy gut lining. We’re thrilled to share that our findings are currently under review for publication—stay tuned for more updates on how A. muciniphila might help balance cell turnover and gut health!

1. April 2023 – Gut-Brain Axis and Alzheimer’s Disease: New In Vitro Study  
                Can gut health influence brain health? We’re diving into this question by studying the impact of gut microbiota on Alzheimer’s disease markers. Using an in vitro model, our team is exploring how gut-derived compounds might impact cellular processes involved in neurodegeneration. This project combines microbiology with neurobiology and could provide early clues for potential therapeutic pathways. We’re excited to see where this innovative research takes us!
